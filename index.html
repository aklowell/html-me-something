            <h2>The SouthSide Spark</h2>
             
  
  <p class ="boxy">
    Working at <a href = "https://www.southside-ecc.org" >SouthSide Early Childhood Center</a> motivated me to dedicate my work and volunteer time to 
        the issue of early care and education. SouthSide, as it is known, is a great program that serves diverse, 
        multi-lingual, primarily low-income families with very high-quality and 
        <b>affordable</b> full-day infant care and preschool. But it is a drop in the bucket compared to the need 
        in St. Louis. While many excellent programs exist in the City, they serve only a fraction of families 
        seeking quality child care that they can afford. <br><br>
        Here's a fun fact about SouthSide: it was founded (with the name South Side Day Nursery) in 1886 by 15 Unitarian women and is the oldest early childhood center 
        in the state of Missouri! These women might look stern, but they had big hearts. Check out the smocks that teachers wore in the picture from the 1950s.<br><br>

            <h2>Quality for All Children</h2>
                <p class="boxy">
                    A dedicated group of volunteers in St. Louis, representing dozens of organizations that serve young children,
                     is working to build a regional system that supports all families and children, especially those who lack access to quality 
                     early care and education and other services. The <a href = "https://www.stlearlychildhood.org" >St. Louis Regional Early Childhood Council</a> advocates for issues at the 
                     state and local level, and is working to create collaborative, comprehensive approaches to the challenges we face. RECC is a data-driven 
                     group. With a starting point of child well-being measures collected in 2013, RECC will continue to monitor the region's 
                     progress in meeting the needs of children and families most in need. One alarming statistic is the shortage of 
                     quality early care and education slots in our City. The map below shows many zip codes with a huge gap in 
                     the supply of licensed and accredited slots (pink and red areas have the biggest gaps in supply):</p>
